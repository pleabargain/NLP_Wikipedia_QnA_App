The goal here is to be able to point the app at any web page and ask questions about the page. The questions and the answers will be saved to a database.


To run this use:
```streamlit run app.py```
In the /src dir

---

You'll need to install streamlit

``` pip install streamlit```

---

and transformers

```pip install transformers```

---

and pytorch

```pip3 install torch-tensorrt -f https://github.com/pytorch/TensorRT/releases```

---

I tried running the app with pytorch installed and the app complained. So I installed tensorflow. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

```pip install tensorflow```

Hopefully one will work!
